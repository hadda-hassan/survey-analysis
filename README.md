# survey-analysis
Internship 2021 UPS department of mathematics

In this folder, we can find 3 ipynb files:
-data claining notebook, which allows you to clean a survey manually,
-abbreviation table.ipynb, which allows you to create a table of abbreviations and corresponding questions
-Sondage_dash_v10.ipynb, which allows you to launch an interractive table producing graphics

You have to launch them in this order, and sometimes modify them.
